%      Thus function is a pitch detector that  takes a vector of linearly 
%      encoded PCM values and returns a pitch track of them, storing the 
%      returned frequencies in frq_path.
%  
%      Example usage:  
%         load laughter;

%         [frq_path, autoCorr_path, time, amp] = praat_pd(y,Fs,display);
%  
%  
%   Output values
%   ----------------
%     frq_path      - a vector of values where frq_path(i) is the best guess
%                   of the  frequency of the fundamental pitch at time(i).
%                   If there is no pitch detected, the pitch is set to 0.
%  
%     autoCorr_path - a vector where autoCorr_path(i) is strength 
%                   of autocorrelation in the window at time step i. This is 
%                   basically a measure of harmonicity and ranges from 0 to 1.
%  
%     time          - a vector of values where time(i) is the time at which
%                   frq_path(i)is determined (measured in seconds).
%  
%     amp           - a vector of amplitudes, where amp(i) is the amplitude of
%                   the signal at time(i).
%  
%  
%   Input arguments 
%   ---------------------------------------------------------
%   NOTE: Other than "in" all input arguments are optional. That said, if you
%   want to specify the ith argument, you have to specify all arguments j <
%   i. For example, if you specify "time_step," then you have to specify "in",
%   "fs", and "display" before specifying "time_step".
%  
%   in                  - a vector of values assumed to be linearly encoded, 
%                         PCM audio
%   fs                  - a scalar that specifies sample frequency of the 
%                         input audio (default 44,100 Hz)
%   display             - a scalar, if set to 1, a display of the output is 
%                         created (default is 0)
%   time_step           - a scalar, the time between window centers of the 
%                         ffts used to find the pitch track(default is 0.01)
%   min_frq             - a scalar, the lowest frequency hypothesis allowed 
%                         (also affects window size of FFTs) (default is 65 Hertz)
%   max_frq             - a scalar, the highest frequency hypothesis allowed  
%                         (default is 1000 Hertz)
%   VoiceThresh         - a scalar that varies what counts as "voiced" (harmonic)  
%                         (default is 0.5, range is 0 to 1)
%   SilThresh           - a scalar that sets the maximum for what counts as  
%                         silence (default is 0.02  range is 0 to 1)
%   OctaveCost          - (default is 0.02)
%   VoicedUnvoicedCost  - (default is 0.2)
%   OctaveJumpCost      - (default is 0.2)
%   Hypotheses          - How many different pitch hypotheses will be considered
%                         (default is 4)
